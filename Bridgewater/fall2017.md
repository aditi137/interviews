# Bridgewater Associates
TA Program for Summer 2018 (summer after sophomore year)

## Process
Coding challenge -> technical phone screen -> onsite

## How Far I Got
Onsite

## Coding Challenge
- HackerRank coding exercise
- given two weeks to complete
- untimed, but expected 1-2 hours to complete
- no language, time, or memory restrictions
- emphasized that I shouldn't try to make it perfect

## Technical Phone Screen
- used a CoderPad environment

Had a bunch of miscellaneous quasi-technical questions, then talked about how I
implemented the coding challenge. I hadn't passed all the public tests, so they
gave me a case that I didn't pass and I debugged the issue. Started
implementing another optimizing feature but ran out of time.

## Onsite 
Under NDA for this part so I can't say much.

## Onsite Logistics
Company paid for a car from/to campus to/from the office. (It was nearby and in
the same state.)

## Notes from the Phone Screen
- interviewers both in trading department
- investment = a big engineering problem
