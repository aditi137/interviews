## Technical
- How would you topologically sort a DAG?
- The interview question was an OOP design for the game Guess Who. It was a
single technical question and you have to go into a lot of depth of the design.
You have to think of each variable and function in each class that you create.
- Given a list of modules and dependencies, output the smallest lexigraphically
ordered list of modules.
- Design a game and a competing computer.
- The case was an open-ended invitation to identify a problem with elevators
and design a software-based solution.
- Design an AI for the battleship board game.
	How would you represent the ships on the board? How would you represent a hit
	on a ship? How would you know if a ship has sunk? How would you know if the
	player's placement of ships on the board was legal? Is there a way to make
	your solution more user-friendly?
- How would you make an elevator better? Asked me to essentially start from 
scratch and develop an algorithm/program to do this.
- How would you design a load-balancing system? 
- A taxicab number is a number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in 
two different ways. How would you find all the taxicab numbers between 1 and 
1,000,000? 

## Behavioral
- Why Bridgewater? What is your weakness?
- How would you improve a company through transparency?
- Tell me about this project on your resume. Looking back, how would you 
improve it now?
- What does your current workplace do? Why do you think it's named the way it 
is named?
- Tell me the failures that have led you to where you are now.
- What is your passion?
- "What's your biggest flaw?" followed up with "Do you think what you're doing is really fixing that flaw, or just addressing the surface level?"
