# Bank of America 
Global Technology Summer Analyst Program with People Technology for Summer 2018
(summer after sophomore year)

## Process
Behavioral/technical phone screen -> final round

## How Far I Got
Final round

## Behavioral/Technical Phone Screen
Don't remember too well, but it couldn't have been too intense since the 
interview was only half an hour.

## Final Round Logistics
Was asked to be free all day for a conference call structure. In actuality,
there were two interviews scheduled for about 30-45 mins each.

## Notes from the Phone Screen
- Sometimes interns have individual projects, but most of the time interns are
part of a team and work closely to the developers 
- Give them un-time constrained projects
- Interviewerâ€™s team develops ATM software
- they use Agile
- He is the manager, guides them in dividing and conquering the work

10 weeks

Projects / What interviewer said
- he would give me UI work
- wants me to do something useful as well learn something new
- might have assignments that he gives as "hw" to teach the rest of the team
