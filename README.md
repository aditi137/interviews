# FAQ

## What is in this repo?
The companies that I've had experience interviewing with and how the
recruiting process went for each of them. Each company has a folder, and each
folder has:
- a file called `questions.md` containing various technical and behavioral
questions I've aggregated from various sources on the web and friends
- 1 or more files called `fall<year>.md` where `year` is the calendar year I
went through the recruiting process for the company

## What kind of information is in this repo?
Among other things, each company's
- recruiting process (number of stages)
- logistics for onsite interviews
- preferred platforms for interviewing (e.g. HackerRank, Codility, etc.)
