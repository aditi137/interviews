## Technical 
- Given two strings, determine whether they are anagrams.
- LCA problem with no parent pointers. Given the root of a tree and pointers to 
two nodes contained in that tree, return the lowest common ancestor of the two 
nodes. IE, the common ancestor furthest from the root.
- Given a list of strings, return a list of lists of strings, which represents 
the list grouping strings by whether they are anagrams of one another.
- Given a number n, find the largest number just smaller than n that can be 
formed using the same digits as n.  
- Design a system to store large numbers and a function to add them.
- Given a full binary tree, find the longest path between any two nodes. 
(Essentially, find the diameter of a full binary tree.)
- Given two strings representing binary numbers, add them together and output 
the resulting binary number as a string.
- Given a word `large` and a word `small`, return the index of `small` in
`large` if it exists and -1 if not. (Basically,
[strstr](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strstr/).)
- Design a data structure that adds, removes, and gets most recently added all
in log(N) time.
- Fibonacci: recursive and iterative.
- You are given 2 streams of data, representing very sparse vectors you are
guaranteed that the 2 incoming streams are of same size give a data structure
which is optimized for producing the dot product of those sparse vectors
analyze your runtime/space complexity. 
	Followup: what if you are now told that v1, is much more sparse than v2 give
	another (or the same) data structure optimized for the dot product of any
	such 2 vectors (where 1 is more sparse than the other)?
	Followup: analyze your runtime/space complexity.
