Software Engineering Internship for Summer 2018 (summer after sophomore year)

## Process
Behavioral/technical phone screen -> coding challenge -> onsite

## How Far I Got
Coding challenge

## Behavioral/technical Phone Screen
This was probably the most enjoyable phone interview I had all season. It was
scheduled for 30 mins, but I clicked with interviewer so well that we spoke for
more than an hour! We'd used some of the same F/OSS technology before, so we
chatted about that at length. I spoke a little about my past technical
experience, and then he asked a series of knowledge-based technical questions.

## Coding Challenge
- no deadline, but soon was better
- three questions in different CS areas with preferred language specifications
that candidate could choose from to implement

## Notes from the Phone Screen
certain attacks on the heap could potentially recover certain bash variables - how catastrophic

- Stack
	- celery - async pass key
	- ansible
	- AWS
	- charting service - nodeJS
	- angular 1.5 frontend
	- mysql single instance

7 years old, based in Chicago  
Have a NYC office with most of engineering  
  
Interns treated as full time  
assigned a feature or epoch to work on over the summer  
see it from start to finish  
exposure to full stack  

Intern past projects:
- nodejs microservice
- mutual fund data (originally did not support that), a lot of research had to
do about how implement API layer and data digestion layer (interns did that)

Planning to have 1-3 interns for summer 2018

Because separate from Chicago office (that one's more business-y) office
culture in NYC office is laidback and more engineering-centric: there are
outings to do go-karting, happy hour, etc. It's easygoing and cohesive.
