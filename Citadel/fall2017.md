# Citadel / Citadel Securities
Software Engineering Internship for Summer 2018 (summer after sophomore year)

## Process
Technical phone screen -> onsite

## How Far I Got
Onsite

## Technical Phone Screen
- CoderPad environment
- no time, memory, or language restrictions

## Onsite Logistics
Company paid for travel from/to campus to/from office in Chicago and hotel.

## Notes from the Phone Screen
- past project: visualizing software to show what was going on behind API and built a server to send results
- interviewer on gqus trading team
- C++, Python, JS
- backend and frontend projects alike
- 10 weeks
- Chicago and NYC are primary offices for internships
- culture is kinda like a startup
- if you try to write a project in Python when the rest of the project is in C++, that might be frowned upon but in general a lot of leeway
