# D.E. Shaw
Systems Technologist Internship for Summer 2018 (summer after sophomore year)

## Process
Technical phone screen -> onsite

## How Far I Got
Onsite

## Technical Phone Screen
Got asked several knowledge based questions about the command line.

## Onsite 
Cancelled because signed with another company

## Onsite Logistics
Company would've covered "all reasonable costs related to [my] travel [there]."

## Notes from the Phone Screen
Systems = auth, services, db, storage  
Trying to think of infra as software instead of hardware

Interviewer  
DB, storage  
- some deliverables: 400 mathematicians and quants, they’re writing sw to do
simulations and projections for the markets 
- setting up new db servers for them. You have these servers, they’re 5 y/o, I
need to find out what bottleneck they’re hitting and solve it so that their sw
is the bottleneck 
- need to graph out stats about hw, like how much memory using, how much paging
in and out. "CPUs aren’t getting faster, so if you use high CPU usage, we need
to figure out how to scale it across servers 
- another project: giant storage backend, ppl try to hammer them into oblivion
from the competing grid, he’s setting up a packet capturing infra where they
capture info on the wire every few secs and graph all the inode et al. info and
we see that there’s one guy who’s hitting it 10k times from one server

Web solutions team
- Lot of unix groups
- Lot of people in sudoers file
- Have a portal named manage groups that handles all of this

Previous intern projects
- ticketing system as well as a third party ticketing project, this person
created a generic middleware
- app that crawled the file system and found passwords + web based dashboard to
aggregate all security dashboards

Most important classes: OS & arch, algos, _Languages and Machines_, bridging
the gap between hw and making your code take advantage of the hw

"If we took you on, we’d probably be taking advantage of your web dev skills"
